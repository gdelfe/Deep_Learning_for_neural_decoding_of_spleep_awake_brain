This project aims to use DEEP LEARNING tools to classify the monkey brain neural activity into sleep and awake states. 
The cortical neural activity of two monkeys is recorded together with the video of the monkeys moving or sleeping in their cage. The video is used to define whether the monkeys are sleeping or awake and moving. Thus, the video provides the labels for a classification problem: sleep/awake. 

DATA:
micro-EcoG of the brain neural activity of two monkeys recorded in Motor cortex (M1), Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), and sensory motor cortex (S1). The data covers several days (~15 days) for each monkey. Every day consists of several hours of continous wireless recording while the monkeys are in their cage (~9h each day).

METHODS:
From the micro-EcoG neural activity of the monkey brain spectogram (time-frequency plots) are generated using a multi-taper spectral analysis.
